"""
This code is part of a Merlin and QBMET collaboration for the Robotic Exoskeleton Leg. 
It takes in EMG data from the delsys trigno system, calibrates it to an individual resting and max strength,
then consistently updates the stream based on the if the person's leg is flexed is not flexed. 

Developed by Merlin Neurotech Club. 
We acknowldge that the base code was written by the DISC598/599 2024/25 research team consisting of: 
Shayne, Kristen, Prisha, and Riya.
